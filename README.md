# BoltzTraP2 Transport Pipeline for MOFs

## Overview

This repository provides an automated workflow for calculating and visualizing the thermoelectric transport properties of Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOFs) using **BoltzTraP2**.

While the current setup is demonstrated on the **ZnPHC MOF**, the pipeline is modular. By simply updating the source directory path, you can apply this workflow to any material with VASP-calculated band structures.

## Features

* **Automated Data Retrieval:** Copies necessary VASP outputs directly from your calculation directories.
* **High-Fidelity Interpolation:** Leverages BoltzTraP2 to expand sparse DFT k-meshes into dense grids for accurate transport integration.
* **Publication-Quality Plotting:** Generates ready-to-use visualizations for Seebeck coefficient, Electrical Conductivity, and Power Factor.
* **Flexibility:** Easily adaptable for different temperatures, relaxation times (), and doping levels.

## What is BoltzTraP2?

**BoltzTraP2** (Boltzmann Transport Properties) calculates semi-classic transport coefficients based on the smoothed Fourier interpolation of the band structure.

* **Seebeck Coefficient ():** Measures the voltage generated by a temperature gradient.
* **Electrical Conductivity ():** The material's ability to conduct charge.
* **Power Factor ():** Calculated as , representing the material's potential for energy harvesting.

##  Usage & Customization

### 1. Adaptation for New Materials

To use this code for a different calculation, you only need to modify the **Configuration Section** in the first cell of `BoltzTraP2_Final.ipynb`:

```python
# --- USER CONFIGURATION ---
DFT_SOURCE_DIR = "../your_dft_output_folder/"  # Path to your VASP files
MATERIAL_NAME = "MyNewMOF"                      # Used for plot labels
INTERP_FACTOR = 5                               # Mesh multiplier (default=5)
# --------------------------

```

### 2. Prerequisites

Ensure your VASP folder contains:

* `vasprun.xml`
* `OUTCAR`
* `POSCAR`
* `POTCAR` (required for some BoltzTraP2 versions)

### 3. Execution

Run the cells in `BoltzTraP2_Final.ipynb` sequentially:

1. **Setup:** Syncs files and creates a local `BoltzTraP2_Working/` directory.
2. **Interpolation:** Generates the `.bt2` file (~1-2 mins).
3. **Integration:** Calculates properties at  (~30 secs).
4. **Visualization:** Produces `transport_properties_ZNPHC.png`.

## Parameters & Assumptions

* **Temperature:**  (Default).
* **Relaxation Time ():**  (Standard approximation for MOFs).
* **Dimensionality:** Optimized for 2D/3D frameworks.
* **Energy Window:** Focused around the Fermi level/Valence Band Maximum.

## Repository Structure

* `BoltzTraP2_Final.ipynb`: The primary executable pipeline.
* `BoltzTraP2_Working/`: Automatically generated folder containing interpolation traces and processed data.
* `transport_properties_ZnPHC.png`: Sample output plot.

##  Troubleshooting

* **File Missing:** Ensure `DFT_SOURCE_DIR` is correct. The script will throw an error if `vasprun.xml` is not found.
* **Memory Limit:** If the kernel crashes during interpolation, lower the `INTERP_FACTOR` to 3 or 4.
* **Silent Commands:** BoltzTraP2 runs in the background without standard output. Check your working folder for the `.bt2` file to verify progress.
